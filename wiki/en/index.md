Welcome to Banana Dance Lite. Here is a very brief quick start guide. For a more in-depth explanation, please reference the quick start guide below:

## Edit this file

To edit this file, simply open "wiki/en/index.md" and have at it.

You can use full markdown and markdown extra.


## Creating More Pages

Just add a new ".md" file in the "wiki/en" folder. So maybe you want to create documentation for the "Installation" process of your program? Simply create a file named "Installation.md".


## Creating More Categories

Notice how there is an "Example" folder in the "wiki/en" folder. Also notice how it shows up in the navigation to the left. That is how you create categories: just add a folder anywhere in the "wiki/en" folder.
