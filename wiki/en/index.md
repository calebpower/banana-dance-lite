## Editing this file

To edit this file, simply open "wiki/en/index.md" and have at it. You can use full <a href="https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/" target="_blank">markdown extra</a>.


## Creating More Pages

Simply create a new ".md" file in the "wiki/en" folder.

Example: maybe you want to create documentation for the "Installation" process of your program? Create a file named "Installation.md".


## Creating More Categories

Notice how there is an "Example_Subcategory" folder in the "wiki/en" folder. Also notice how the navigation on the left shows a sub-category named "Example_Subcategory".

That is how you create categories: you a folder anywhere in the "wiki/en" folder.
