/**
 * This file allows you to create a list of "named routes". Named routes are hard coded
 * routes that you can link to from outside (or inside the wiki). The benefit of named
 * routes is that down the line, if you change a file name or change the structure of
 * your wiki, you can update this file rather than searching of references to the page
 * within existing page links.
 *
 * When building a link, link to the "?l=ROUTE_NAME" page.
